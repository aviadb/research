\section{Bark-Scaling}


\subsection{Bark Critical Bands}

First method introduced in \cite{doi:10.1121/1.1908630}


A proposed approximation to the bark scaling is described in 
\cite{doi:10.1121/1.399849}. This paper also introduces the 
correction of the band boundaries to ensure more 
correctness with the original bark scaling.
