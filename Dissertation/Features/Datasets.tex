\section{CHiME 4/5}
\subsection{Overview}
The CHiME-4 dataset is provided 
as part of the CHiME challenge.

The challenge is to build an ASR model
for multi-microphone device being used
in various noisy environments.

Six microphones are mounted on a tablet
device and are recorded with a high-resolution
multi-track recorder. Besides those six 
microphones, an additional 
close-talking microphone is recorded by
another recording device, daisy-chained to the
multi-microphone recording device.

The close-talking microphone is referenced as
the clean speech channel.
